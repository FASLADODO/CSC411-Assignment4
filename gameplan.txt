Gameplan:
- definately ensemble methods
- upwards of 10
	- neural nets
	- naive bayes
	- adaboost something
	- svm
- look to use unlabeled data set (maybe).  Most likely for something like PCA.


- neural net (taken from past homework stuff)
	- number of hiddens
	- learning rate
	- momentum
	- stopping code
- naive bayes

^LOOK AT DIS SHIT.
ISN"T IT NEAT.
WOULND"T YOU SAY THIS ALGORITHM IS COMPLETE.

WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT THIS CODE, THIS CODE CLASSIFIES ... EVERYTHING
